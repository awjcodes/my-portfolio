# My-Portfolio

## Description

Instead of having a Traditional Resume that only shows text of who I am, what I have accomplished and my overall background. Being able to have a website that showcases my skills, talents, and work to the user and employer gives them a better understanding of who I am, and what I have achieved visually with a creative twist!
