# My-Portfolio

## Description

Instead of having a Traditional Resume that only shows text of who I am, what I have accomplished and my overall background. Being able to have a website that showcases my skills, talents, and work to the user and employer gives them a better understanding of who I am, and what I have achieved visually with a creative twist!

NAV Bar, and Profile Section inspired:
In the HTML Nav element, we have a section for the logo and the navigation choices. Having a seperate section for the logo and navigation options, will make CSS styling easy to identify and style along with the classes. Everything under the nav element will make us be able to style the whole child elements underneath to be aligned and centered to our liking in css. Within the CSS Nav section, we assign the nav element in css to justify-content. Which makes all the child elements with the parent element nav be spaced from each other but have also space at the edges. Similar to space-between, but the edges dont have space. Align-Items aligns our child elements at the center (y-axis). Than to finish it off we adjust how tall we want our nav bar to be by using the height property and setting it to 15 viewport height.

In the HTML Profile Section, we created a whole section that has other sections within it. Such as a section for a picture of myself, a place for the text, interactable buttons, and social media icons that are responsive. For each section there is a class or an ID to stylize within CSS. The seperated sections make it easy to stylize a certain section. Within the profile section, how we made the icons lead us to another webpage, is by using the onclick="" attribute with location.href='*insert link here*'. The location.href is similar to the href but is used differently. the location.href is for changing where you are on the internet to a different webpage, while href is telling your web links where they should take you when you click them.
